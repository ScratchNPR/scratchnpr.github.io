              <p>Starting in September of 2015, the young programmers of MIT's Scratch web site (plus a couple of adults who'd stumbled upon the site by accident) decided to take a break from writing computer science projects and video games, to see what would happen when they turned their hands to creating art.  The results were interesting and sometimes surprising.  For many of the participants this was the first time they had created anything artistic.  Although initially the plan had been to imitate existing artistic styles, they soon started creating original works. Browse the images here and click on them to learn more about each project.</p>
